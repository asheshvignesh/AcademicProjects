# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository showcases a collection of projects that I worked on during my course and out of personal interest to deepen my understanding of Data Science and Machine Learning concepts. Each project represents a specific area of study or application, reflecting my hands-on learning experience in the field.

## Project List

1. **Amazon Electrical Recommendation**: A project to recommend electrical products using machine learning techniques.
2. **Automatic Ticket Assignment**: A system that assigns support tickets to the appropriate teams or individuals automatically.
3. **Classification_MNIST_CNN**: A convolutional neural network for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
4. **Concrete_analysis**: Analysis of the compressive strength of concrete using features such as age and material composition, with 1030 observations.
5. **Digit_identification_kNN**: A k-Nearest Neighbors model for identifying handwritten digits, likely using a dataset like MNIST.
6. **Face_detection**: A project on detecting faces in images using computer vision techniques.
7. **Face_recognition**: A project on identifying and verifying faces in images or videos.
8. **Image Occlusion**: A project analyzing the impact of occlusions in images on the predictions of a pre-trained VGG19 model, possibly involving CNN interpretability techniques.
9. **MNIST_CNN_History**: An analysis or visualization of training history for an MNIST CNN model.
10. **Neural Style Transfer**: A project implementing neural style transfer to merge content and style from two images.
11. **PIMA Indian_Predictive**: A predictive analysis project using the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset.
12. **PIMA Indians EDA**: Exploratory Data Analysis on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset.
13. **Sales Analysis of Bank**: An analysis of bank sales data to identify trends and insights.
14. **Vehicle Classification**: Classification of vehicle silhouettes into bus, van, or car using extracted features.
